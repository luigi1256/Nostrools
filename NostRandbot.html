			"What are relays? Nostr relays are decentralized servers that are used to store and transmit notes and events on the Nostr protocol. They are essential for the operation of Nostr, as they allow users to communicate with each other without having to rely on a central server. Nostr relays are sometimes referred to as the 'dumb' powerhouses of the protocol. <img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1653880770891591682/Uh8HZJ3w_400x400.jpg' widht=20px height='20px'>   GG",
			"Nostr relays are run by volunteers all over the world. This makes Nostr censorship-resistant, as it is not possible for any one entity to control all of the relays.When a user creates a note or event on Nostr, clients broadcast this information to the user's relays to be stored and later retrieved by other clients. <img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1653880770891591682/Uh8HZJ3w_400x400.jpg' widht=20px height='20px'>  HH",
			"Nostr relays are also responsible for verifying the authenticity of notes. This is done by using a cryptographic signature that is attached to each note. When a user receives a note, their client verifies the signature to ensurethat the note has not been tampered with.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1653880770891591682/Uh8HZJ3w_400x400.jpg' widht=20px height='20px'>  II",
			"Nostr relays are a critical part of the Nostr protocol. They allow users to communicate with each other censorship-resistantly, securely, and 'anyone' can run one. JJ",
			"What relays should I use? You want to use a diverse set of relays along with relaysthat your friends, family, and people you know use. If you do not share at least one relay in common with someone, you may not be able to communicate with one another across the Nostr protocol. KK",
			"Nostr clients will either bootstrap a list of pre-configured, default relays for you to use or recommend relays for you to use. These are a good place to start, but it's recommended to reach out to your friends to see what relays they are using or to joina local community or interest based relay. LL",
			"A list of all Nostr relays can be found at <a href='https://nostr.watch'>nostr.watch</a>   MM",
			"Should I run my own relay? Yes. This puts you in charge of your social data and your entire social graph for the very first time. This helps you stay censorship resistant. If a relay would happen to censor you, ban you, or disappear, you still have all of your data on your own personal relay. NN",
			"Nostr relays are not like Pokemon, you don't need to catch them all.      OO",
			"Decentralized, Nostr does not rely on any central servers. Users connect to multiple independent relays run by different entities. This makes it censorship-resistant.   NN ", 
			"Event-based, All data in Nostr takes the form of cryptographically signed events. Events can contain text, file metadata, chat messages, etc.   PP",
			"Key-based identities, Users are identified by public keys. Private keys are used to sign events.    QQ",
			"Relays, These servers accept events from clients and broadcast events to clients. Anyone can run a relay. Relays don't need to be trusted.   RR", 
			"Tagging, Events can contain tags to classify content. This enables discovery and filtering.    SS ",
			"Ephemeral data, Nostr supports ephemeral events that are broadcast but not persisted. Useful for things like chat.  TT",
			"Replaceable data, Nostr has a replaceable event type where the latest event replaces older ones. Useful for profiles.  UU",
			"Encrypted messaging, Nostr has built-in end-to-end encrypted direct messaging between public keys.    VV",
			"Verifiable Signatures, keys, and event IDs are all cryptographically verifiable by clients   WW ",		
			"Extensible, The protocol is designed to be extended with new event kinds via NIPs (Nostr Implementation Proposals).   XX",
			"Interoperable, Common event kinds work across different clients and relays.    YY",
			"In summary, Nostr is a decentralized, secure, extensible protocol optimized for social media and apps. Identities, data, and infrastructure are all user-controlled. ZZ",
